Provided in this .zip are two methods of running the code.

1 - Eclipse Project Files

The Eclipse Project files are provided and can opened by either Eclipse or Notepad++

As far as I am aware, the project will only run properly in Eclipse, so I have provided an executable as well

2 - Executable

Provided in Assignment1.jar is the executable to run the program outside of Eclipse

It can be started by either double clicking on the .jar or by running the start.exe bat

Note, the start.exe is included specifically for the purpose of running the .jar if it should, for one reason or another, fail to run
It will open the program in the CMD Console and execute exactly as it would in Eclipse
